### **Installation Guide: Atlas**

Atlas is a data-centric AI framework that requires a few system dependencies and Python packages to function properly. This guide walks you through the setup process step by step.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

Atlas relies on **FFmpeg** for media decoding and encoding. Make sure it's installed before proceeding.

#### macOS

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

#### Windows

You can install FFmpeg via [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) if installed:

```bash
choco install ffmpeg
```

> **Note (macOS only):** If FFmpeg was installed with Homebrew and Atlas still fails to find it, set the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:
>
> ```bash
> export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(brew --prefix)/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
> ```

---

### 2. Python Installation

Ensure you are using Python **3.8 or newer**. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv atlas-env
source atlas-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: atlas-env\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 3. Install Atlas (Base Version)

Install Atlas from PyPI:

```bash
pip install atlas-ai
```

---

### 4. Optional: Audio Dataset Support

If you intend to work with audio datasets (e.g., speech, sound classification), you need additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install atlas-ai[audio]
```

This installs `soundfile`, required for reading and processing audio formats.

---

### 5. Verify Installation

Run the following command to confirm Atlas is installed:

```bash
python -c "import atlas; print('Atlas version:', atlas.__version__)"
```

---

### 6. (Optional) Install Development Tools

If you're contributing to Atlas or running it from source, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/atlas.git
cd atlas
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
